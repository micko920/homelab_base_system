# This gives a warning, see below. This can not be stopped. It is a bit of a
# chicken and egg problem. It resolves itself once through this file.  It
# relates to the apt, python-pip and pacakage ansible module.
#
# [WARNING]: Updating cache and auto-installing missing dependency: python-apt
# [WARNING]: Could not find aptitude. Using apt-get instead
# Only have this to shut the apt module up. Please remove once the ansible
# module stops using the apptitude tool
